There was an error interacting with your Othermail because we don't know who you are! You emailed us from <%= @from_user %>
which we don't seem to have an account for. You might have emailed us from the wrong account or we might have screwed up.

If you think this is an error, please feel free to email us at support@<%= Multiplex::Application::Domain %>. We'll be glad to answer any questions 
you have and fix any problems you might be having with Othermail.

You can also create a new account at Othermail at <%= new_user_registration_url %> if you want.

Thanks for choosing Othermail!
